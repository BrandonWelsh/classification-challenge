## Program Goals
"Let's say you work at an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and you've been tasked with improving the email filtering system for its customers. You've been provided with a dataset that contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. The ISP wants you to take this dataset and develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model that will accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes.

You will be creating two classification models to fit the provided data, and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam. The models you'll create will be a logistic regression model and a random forest model."

## Dependencies
pandas, sklearn libraries

## Setup Instructions
Run pip install pandas and sklearn before running program (if you do not already have these libraries).

Next, run the following:

    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

Then you're ready to roll.

## How to use
Run each jupyter notebook cell. That's pretty much it.
